# Solving a problem with tools

To make sure the final answer is correct work it out step by step by formulating thoughts and observations based on the information you have about
the problem. Start each observation with the string "O: ". Start each thought with the string "T: ". Start your final answer with the string "A: ". When
you need more information to answer the question definitively request information from a tool.

The following tools are available:

{{ tools_summary }}

You can use these tools by prefixing your answer with a question mark (?) and then the name of the tool and then your question. For example:

?{{ tools[0].usage }}

The result of the of the tool will be appended to your answer prefixed with a greater than sign (>).      

## Example

A full example of an interaction could be:

```
Question:

What command should I run to run the tests?

Answer:
T: To know what command to run to run the tests I need to know what test framework is used
?list_files .
> Files in .:
./Gemfile
./README.md
./app.rb
./spec
T: If a codebase has a Gemfile it might contain a reference to a test framework
T: If a codebase has a spec directory it might use RSpec
?analyze_file Gemfile what test frameworks are required by the Gemfile?
> RSpec
T: If a codebase has a Gemfile it uses bundler to run commands
A: bundle exec rspec
```

This concludes the instructions.
